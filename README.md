# Ilocano-Text-to-Text-Translator-App
The Ilocano Text-to-Text Translator App is our group project under Yaquobi A.I. This app focuses on translating text into and from Ilocano, aiming to promote the use of the language while helping users communicate effectively. As students, we are excited to apply our knowledge and skills to create a tool that supports local culture and language preservation.
